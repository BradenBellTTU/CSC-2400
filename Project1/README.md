# Project 1 for CSC-2400

## Corrections for Bonus1:
- Inputs with negative numbers now return the proper GCD
- Inputs with a negative, zero types now return the proper GCD

### Original Instructions:
```
Project1
Deadline - September 1, 23. Upload your solution to the dropbox in iLearn.

Part1. (50%) Exercise 1.1: 11a /page 8

Part2. (50%) Implement Consecutive integer checking algorithm for computing gcd(m, n).

Part3. (30%) (BONUS) Implement Middle-school procedure for computing gcd(m, n).

	The goal of this programming assignment is to implement a function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) 
of two integers, and then output the result along with the provided input values. You will be required to create a 
command-line program that takes two integer arguments, m and n, calculates their GCD, and displays the result in the format: 
gcd(m, n) = v, where m and n are the input values, and v is the calculated GCD, or "undefined" if no GCD exists.

	You have the flexibility to implement each algorithm using the programming language of your choice.

	Your project implementations must meet the following requirements:
- Compile without any warnings.
- Include proper documentation.

Ensure that your solution adheres to the specified requirements.

GitHub Repository Setup and Sharing (6%):
Create a GitHub repository for Project 1.
Upload all relevant files and resources related to Project 1 to this repository.
Share the repository with both myself and TA Cristina. Our usernames are crad23 and bkubiak@tntech.edu respectively.

The deadline for this assignment is October 6th. Please note that late submissions will be subject to the same rules as any 
other project.


Points distribution for this assignemt:
- (6%) Uploading and sharing project1 files on GitHub.
- (12%) Part1. Exercise 1.1: 11a /page 8
- (12%) Part2. Implement Consecutive integer checking algorithm for computing gcd(m, n).
- (5%) Part3. Implement Middle-school procedure for computing gcd(m, n).

Each implemented algorithm will be graded according to the following rubric.
- Compiles without warnings and the code 'looks correct' accounts for 25% of the grade for a part. (This criteria ensures 
that 25% is allocated for code that is relevant to the task at hand and appears to be well-written.)
- Well-documented code: 25%
- Correct functionality for specified inputs:
gcd(0, 0) undefined: 5%
gcd (13, 0) = 13: 5%
gcd (0, 13) = 13: 5%
gcd(0, -13) = 13: 5%
gcd(16, 24) = 8: 5%
gcd(24, 16) = 8: 5%
gcd(13, 26) = 13: 5%
gcd(26, 13) = 13: 5%
gcd(-65, -105) = 5: 5%
gcd(-105, -65) = 5: 5%

If you encounter any challenges during this process, please don't hesitate to reach out for assistance.
